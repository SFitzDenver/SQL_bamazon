# SQL_bamazon

## Overview

This app initially displays a list of products available for purchase from the store inventory which is maintained in a SQL database. The user is prompted as to which item they would like to purchase and how many units of that item they would like to purchase. 

    If the items has enough inventory to fulfill the order, the user will see the message "It's yours!" and the total charge for their         purchase. 
    
    If the item has lower inventory that the user has requested, they will see a message letting them know how many units are in               stock and asking if they would like to purchase that many units. If the user responds yes, the sale will be processed. The user will       see the message "Great!" and the total charge for their purchase. If the user responds no, they will see the message "Thank you for         shopping. Please come again soon." 
    
    If the item is out of stock, the user will the message "Sorry, that item is currently out of stock." and will be asked if they would       like to purchase a different item. If the user responds yes, they are again asked which item they would like to purchase. If the user       respons no, they will see the message "Thank you for shopping. Please come again soon."

    Each time an order is filled the stock is depleted from the store's inventory.
